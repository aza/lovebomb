Features:
* DISTRIBUTION: Attach FB ID to each recipient/friend/bomber name, so we can associate back to an FB account
* DISTRIBUTION: Support ability to invite more people from home screen
* DISTRIBUTION: Support ability to invite more people from permalink page (after recording, want to invite someone else?)
* DISTRIBUTION: Create permalink url once creator connects w/ FB and chooses recipient
* LOVE_QUALITY: Let bombers record multiple love message after recording first one (prompt, "if you'd like to leave another, press 1") then store in same lovebomb
* DISTRIBUTION: Let bombers connect with FB and invite other friends who haven't been invited yet)
* CALL_COMPLIANCE: If bomber misses call, allow them to call Twilio number back and route them back to the original lovebomb (look up incoming caller phone #, match against most recent lovebomb they've been invited to)
* CALL_COMPLIANCE: Use FB info for contact name and only call during timezone-appropriate hours
* LOVE_QUALITY: Prompt lovebomb starter for "why does X need love right now?" to get a reason (eg. X just started chemotherapy, X has been feeling down, X's dog just died, X kicked ass on their project, etc) and then play back that reason to the other invited lovebombers (philosophy: when a man has a 'why', they can withstand almost any how). Experiment with audio & written versions (for  more persuasive invitations too â€“ eg text & email invitations to make lovebomb)

Long-term:


Ideas:
* GREETING/INVITATION: Default to computer voice, but let instigator record a custom invitation, e.g. "Victoria just started chemotherapy last week and I wanted her friends to say how much they love her and support her. Could you record a quick message for her?"
