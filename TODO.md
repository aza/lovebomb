TODO:

Call prompt ideas:
"What's something you love about P?"
"What's a positive memory you have with P?"
"What's something you admire about P?"
"What should P know about him/herself that ?"


PRIORITIES:

- Fix recordFriend so it actually works
- Unique invite links from review links (for instigator) from final-link (for recipient)
- Short IDs 
- Sending text messages to instigator for every "signed" contribution from invitee
- Removing FB / typeahead / complex flows -- going to Philip's simple flow
- Copy / paste link after call is recorded

Features:
* WELCOME: Welcome screen add example love phrases floating by lightly in the background of the page so people get the picture quickly (eg. "I love her gentle smile", "He's my best friend", "I love how supportive and giving she is")
* DISTRIBUTION: Attach FB ID to each recipient/friend/bomber name, so we can associate back to an FB account
* DISTRIBUTION: Support ability to invite more people from home screen
* DISTRIBUTION: Support ability to invite more people from permalink page (after recording, want to invite someone else?)
* DISTRIBUTION: Create permalink url once creator connects w/ FB and chooses recipient
* LOVE_QUALITY: Let bombers record multiple love message after recording first one (prompt, "if you'd like to leave another, press 1") then store in same lovebomb
* POKEYOKE: Don't let people invite duplicates (don't send duplicate invites to same person who multiple people invite separately)
* POKEYOKE: Don't call/text people during bad moments in time zone
* DISTRIBUTION: Let bombers connect with FB and invite other friends who haven't been invited yet)
* CALL_COMPLIANCE: If bomber misses call, allow them to call Twilio number back and route them back to the original lovebomb (look up incoming caller phone #, match against most recent lovebomb they've been invited to)
* CALL_COMPLIANCE: Use FB info for contact name and only call during timezone-appropriate hours
* LOVE_QUALITY: Prompt lovebomb starter for "why does X need love right now?" to get a reason (eg. X just started chemotherapy, X has been feeling down, X's dog just died, X kicked ass on their project, etc) and then play back that reason to the other invited lovebombers (philosophy: when a man has a 'why', they can withstand almost any how). Experiment with audio & written versions (for  more persuasive invitations too â€“ eg text & email invitations to make lovebomb)
* 

Long-term:


Ideas:
* GREETING/INVITATION: Default to computer voice, but let instigator record a custom invitation, e.g. "Victoria just started chemotherapy last week and I wanted her friends to say how much they love her and support her. Could you record a quick message for her?"
